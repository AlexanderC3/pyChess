# pyChess![](images/bk.png)
basic python chess application 


**TODO:**
  - drag move pieces instead of moving them by clicking
  - move logica: castling, en passant, promotion
  - determine if king is in check
  - checkmate
  - buttons for undo and redo moves
  - long run: apply intelligence -> bots
  - commenting code -> clusterfuck



**File structure:**
  * chess_board
  * chess_piece -> individual chess piece movement logics
  * utils -> mouse events handling
  * main
  * constants?


**Imrovements:**
 + efficency ?
 + refactoring
 + bugs
